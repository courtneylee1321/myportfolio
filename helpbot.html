                                    Elijah has just finished his orientation and was given information about the company, volunteer opportunities, health benefits, and more. Henry the Helpbot sends you the slide deck from orientation so that you can refer back to it any point.

                                    Elijah has been at the company for a few days and he received Agile training, but can’t remember all the different terms that were discussed. In this scenario, Elijah can’t remember what scrum master is so he decides to ask Henry. Henry gives him a definition and a link to more training that he could do online.

                                This project showed me how important it is to iterate in order to make sure you truly have a full grasp on the scope of the problem you are trying to solve.

                                Our problem kept changing as we found more information about social anxiety &amp; we ran into trouble focusing on one issue

                                One aspect I’d like to improve on is trying to avoid leading questions during interviews.

                                Elijah has been at the company for a few days and he received Agile training, but can’t remember all the different terms that were discussed. In this scenario, Elijah can’t remember what scrum master is so he decides to ask Henry. Henry gives him a definition and a link to more training that he could do online.
