In this scenario, Elijah can’t remember what scrum master is so he decides to ask Henry. Henry gives him a definition and a link to more training that he could do online.

                                This project showed me how important it is to iterate in order to make sure you truly have a full grasp on the scope of the problem you are trying to solve.

                                One aspect I’d like to improve on is trying to avoid leading questions during interviews. I found it tough to make sure I wasn’t leading participants or interviewees to answer a certain way.
