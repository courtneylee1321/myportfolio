            3 teammates and I picked 5 artifacts and took photos of them with different views such as front and sides. We took frame-by-frame photos, turning the artifact little by little with each photo.

            These GIFs are being saved to be displayed on the museum’s website. They are currently putting together a kiosk to place in the museum so visitors can use it to learn more about Trenton’s history. 
            <br>
            <br>

            This project was more meaningful and fulfilling from previous projects I’ve worked on since our work wasn’t just about getting a good grade.  We were find a way  to foster more learning about Trenton’s history to take place. 
            <br> 
            <br>

            Unfortunately, more work needs to be done to find information about where these artifacts came from and the years they originated. Historians at the Trentoniana   are still searching their origins. </p>
