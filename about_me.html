                Hello again :) 
                <br> 
                <br> 

                If I were to choose one word to describe myself, it would be creative. 
                <br>
                <br>

                When I was younger, my go-to tools to make things were paper, crayons, color pencils,  stickers, and anything else I could find. One of my favorite childhood projects was a shoe-box birthday cake for my mom; she still puts things in there today. Creating little projects like this sparked my interest in learning how to paint, draw, and color. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    

                When I started at The College of New Jersey, I began to experience the broad horizons of creativity: coding websites, modeling and creating animations, developing a virtual reality game, and so much more.
                <br> 
                <br> 

                It was during my sophomore year when I discovered user experience design. It was a field that included things that I loved and valued- design, coding, psychology, and most importantly empathy- all rolled up into one. 
                <br> 
                <br> 

                My favorite aspect of user experience design is that the primary goal has always remained the same: help people. Growing up with an older brother with Asperger’s, I have always had the drive to empathize and understand him and this has translated to my relationships with others.  Being understood in the world is every individual’s desire and as UX designers, our jobs are to achieve this very simple yet complex human need. I’m a lifelong and ambitious learner who’s happiest when I help others.
